## Project description

This is a simple and small project to play around with astro. The main object is to create a 'forum' like CRUD application making use of the SSR features the Astro community has developed.

I plan to use Svelte for the UI components, but right now is just a plain HTML and JS app. I'll be using the node adapter for the backend and a postgresql database to store the data.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
